This may be a useful reference expecially for CPM3 when i get around to supporting it:

CPM
Delete file
   Mark the first byte in the BAM as 0xE5 for each dirent
Add file
 allocate a dirent per 16k 
 allocate a block per block
 Blocks seem to be in order
 Dirent seem to be in order by not sequential

Recover file
  Find file
  check dirents are correct (None missing)
  check blocks have not been re-used
  if all ok, reset the 0xe5 tags to 0 on each bam


====================================================================
AMS file:
====================================================================
  The first 256 bytes are the "disk information block".
  There are two types, Normal and Extended
  
  Normal:
  	00-16 "MV - CPCEMU Disk-File\r\n"
  	17-21 "Disk-Info\r\n"
  	22-2f Name of the creator
  	30    Number of tracks
  	31    Number of sides
  	32-33 Track size 
  	34-FF Unused
  	
  Extended:
  	00-16 "EXTENDED CPC DSK File\r\n"
  	17-21 "Disk-Info\r\n"
  	22-2f Name of the creator
  	30    Number of tracks
  	31    Number of sides
  	32-33 Not used
  	34-FF For each track, one byte representing MSB of track size, 
  				Eg, of the track length is 4864 (0x1300 = 9 sectors of 512 bytes + 256 bytes for the track header)
  					then the byte would be 13
  
  From $100 onwards is the track data. 
	For each track:
	00-0b "Track Info\r\n"
	0c-0f unused
	10    Track number
	11    Side number
	12-13 unused
	14    Sector size (1=256, 2=512, 3=1024 ect) 
	15    Number of sectors 
	16    Gap#3 length
	17    Filler byte

  Next from 18 onwards, is the sector list information.
  Note that the sectors in the file are not nesserilly consecutive (Indeed i have found they are mostly interleaved)  
  This list is the same order as the data in the file
  There are 8 bytes per record
    00    Track (Equivelent to "C" parameter in the 765 FDC)
    01    Side   (Equivelent to "H" parameter in the 765 FDC)
    02    Sector ID (Equivelent to "R" parameter in the 765 FDC) (These are 1-9 for +3 disks, Others use $40-49 and $C0-C9)
    03    Sector size  (Equivelent to "N" parameter in the 765 FDC) should be the same as #14 above
    04    FDC status register 1 after reading
    05    FDC status register 2 after reading
    06-07 Actual data length of the sector in bytes
    
  At the next $100 boundary, the actual data starts.
  this is just a stream of data for each sector in the same order and with the same size as the data above. 
  
====================================================================
CPM file system as used on the Speccy/Amstrad CPC
====================================================================
https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/amsform.html
There are a few things need to identify the CPM parameters used on a disk.
   Firstly, check the minimum sector ID;
   		$41: CPC system disk - These have two tracks reserved for the CPM bootsector. (9216 bytes). This leaves 171k for files (minus 2k directory entries)
			numsides = 1
			numtracks = 40
			numsectors = 9
			sectorPow = 2; (512 bytes/sector)
			reservedTracks = 2;  
			blockPow = 3; (1024 bytes/block)
			dirBlocks = 2;
			rwGapLength = 0x2a;
			fmtGapLength = 0x52;
   		$C1: CPC data disk - These have NO tracks reserved, thus the directory starts on Track 0, first sector. This gives the full 180K for data (minus 2k directory entries)
			numsides = 1
			numtracks = 40
			numsectors = 9
			sectorPow = 2 (512 bytes/sector);
			reservedTracks = 0;
			blockPow = 3 (1024 bytes/block;
			dirBlocks = 2;
			rwGapLength = 0x2a;
			fmtGapLength = 0x52;
   		$01: Speccy +3 / CPC - These have a default set of parameters, but *CAN* be overridden.  As +3 disks have 1 reserved track, this gives 175 for data (Minus the usual 2k)
   			numsides = 1
			numtracks = 40
			numsectors = 9
			sectorPow = 2 (512 bytes/sector);
			reservedTracks = 1;
			blockPow = 3 (1024 bytes/block);
			dirBlocks = 2;
			rwGapLength = 0x2a;
			fmtGapLength = 0x52;
			
		These values can be overridden on the +3 and CPC if there is any data in the bootsector. (Track 0 Head 0 Sector 1) 
		The bootsector is arranged as follows if present. If its full of $e5, the defaults above should be used
		
		00    0 = +3 format 1=CPC system, 2=CPC data, 3=PCW range 
		01    Sidedness: 0=single sided, 1=double sided (Alternative sides) 2=Double sidded (Successive sides)   
   		02    Tracks per side
   		03    Sectors per track
   		04    Sector size shift. 1=256, 2=512, 3=1024 ect
   		05    Number of reserved tracks
   		06    Block size shift 2=512, 3=1024, 4=2048 ect
   		07    Number of directory blocks
   		08    Gap length (RW)
   		09    Gap length(Format)
   		0A-0E reserved
   		0F    Checksum fiddle byte for bootable disks.
   		
   			Note, for the checksum all the bytes in the bootsector are added together (Ignoring any carries).
   			This number should be:  3 = Spectrum +3 bootable disk
   			    					1 = Bootable PCW9512 disk
   			    					255 = Bootable PCW8256 disk
   			 
	Logical blocks. 
		cpm logical blocks start after the reserved tracks and includes the reserved blocks for the directory. 
		Sector order is: CHS if sidedness is 0 or 1, or HCS if 2. By default assume CHS
		
	Directories. 
		The first (usually 2) blocks are reserved for the directory.  This is an array of 32 byte DIRENT Structure. 
		each of these arrays represent 16k of a file. A file can have up to 512 of these entries.
		
		A file is one or more of these DIRENTS. They are in order, but not nesseserilly sequential.
		
		A dirent is arranged as follows:
 		00    Status
 		01-08 filename
        09-0B Extension 
        0C    Lower 4 bits are the extent number
        0D    Number of bytes in the last used 128 byte record where 0=128)
        0E    Lower 5 bits are the upper bits of the extent number
 		0F    Number of 128 byte records used in the last logical extent. All previous extents are considered to be full.  
        10-1F Block numbers. 
 
 		In the filename and the extension. Bit 7 can be used for various flags. (So should be masked off) 
 		The flags that are valid for CPM/+3 are:  [09] is read-only, 
 		                                          [0A] is system and
 		                                          [0B] is Archived.
 		                                          
 		The extent number is [AAAAABBBB] where AAAA is the lower 5 bits of $0E BBBB is the lower 4 bits of $0C
 		 
		File is CPM are multiples of 128 bytes long. To determine the exact length, value of $0F is the number of 128 byte records in the last DIRENT. (The other dirents can be assumed to be full)

+3 extensions.
====================================================================

  https://worldofspectrum.org/ZXSpectrum128+3Manual/chapter8pt27.html
	
	The main +3 Extension is the addition as a header of 128 bytes at the start of each file. 
	This file contains data as follows:
	
	00-07 "PLUS3DOS"
    08    Soft EOF character provided when reading and the file runs out. (1A on the +3)
    09    Issue number
    0A    Version number
    0B-0E Filesize including the header length - LSB first
    0F-16 BASIC header (See below)
    17-7E Reserved (0)
    7F    Checksum byte
    
  Checksum is simply the modulus of the9 bytes from 0-126 
  Easily generated by z80 by just adding all the bytes together and ignoring any carry's  
  
 
  	BASIC header (bytes 0F-16)
  	This is similar to the tape header minus the filename. 
    See https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/Spectrum_tape_interface#Header_block   for that information. 
 	------------------------------
    0F     File type (0=PROG, 1=Number array, 2=Character array, 3=code
    10-11  File length as seen by +3 BASIC
    12-13  PROG: Program Run line;  CODE: default load address, ARRAY: contains the encoded array name and type. (Note 1) 
    14-15  PROG: Program offset. Unused for CODE, arrays. 
 
 Notes:
 1: For Arrays, The array name (ALways 1 char) is encoded as follows:
          1Y0XXXXX     where Y=1 for String array, 0 for numeric. and XXXXX is the character - 0x60
          	EG, 0x94 = 10010100 = Numeric array, Variable J   
          	    0X98 = 10011000 = Numeric Array, Variable x
          	    0xC8 = 11011000 = String array, Variable x$
    In reality, as you can get this information from 0x0f, its probably best to just mask off the top
    two bits and add 0x60.
